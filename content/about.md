My blog about what I'm learning and trying out in the world of cloud, data and self hosting

### Why Moda?

I did the usual (for now) process of asking LLMs to generate my blog name, but they were all quite predictable, like CloudWorks. The most creative name it could think of was SnowyStack, which sounds nice but 

Then it struck me that this doesn't have to be confined to English. The word for "cloud" in the Kannada language is Moda (ಮೋಡ). Written in English, it also sounds similar to "Mode", a statistical property of numerical data. So Moda it is.


### Why Sekiro?

The domain name was suggested by Cloudflare when I entered my own name. It sounded cool and and was within my price range, so I went for it. 

Turns out, Sekiro is also the name of [a highly acclaimed video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice). Which sounds interesting, so even though it has nothing to do with this blog, I might try it some time
